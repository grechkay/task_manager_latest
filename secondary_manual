This is a task and workflow optimization helper.

The first thing to do is to name the directory that was
pulled from github as 'core' and put it in your home directory.

Now, you have to have the following installed:
taskwarrior
timewarrior

Python3

Python Packages:
jsonpath
pandas
matplotlib
taskw

If you are using Ubuntu, then the initial_setup.sh should be able
to install all of these dependencies. (Uncomment the commands as 
necessary)

In any case, go to the setup_scripts directory and run the initial_setup.sh
script to create the necessary directories.

You can read the documentation about taskwarrior here: https://taskwarrior.org/
This project aims to extend the functionality of taskwarrior by adding the 
ability to take notes and track your goals and habbits as well as produce
various reports about them.

The following is the functionality of this project:
python ~/core/task_scripts/goals.py [YYYY-MM-DD] [timeline] -> timelines are: daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly
python ~/core/task_scripts/project_note.py [project] [note_name] -> Opens a note for the given project (projects are specified in the taskwarrior with the tag main, and they are given the same value for 'project' and 'description' field)
python ~/core/task_scripts/project_readme.py [project] -> opens the readme file for the project
python ~/core/task_scripts/project_min.py -> Opens your minimum daily task document
python ~/core/task_scripts/start_track.py [target] [min] [max] [up/down] [aggregation] (usual aggregation: mean/sum)
python ~/core/task_scripts/track.py [target] [date] [value]
python ~/core/task_scripts/trackplot.py [num_weeks]
python ~/core/task_scripts/temp_task.py -> opens the temp task document
python ~/core/task_scripts/report.py -> aggregated your goal documents into a weekly report


It is recommended to create aliases for these commands.
