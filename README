The first thing to do is to name the directory that was
pulled from github as 'core' and put it in your home directory.

1) In your ~/.bash_profile add the line (without the quotes): "export PERSONAL_DIRECTORY=personal"
2) Run "source ~/.bash_profile"
3) Install taskwarrior (brew install task)
4) Execute "task list" in your command line in order for taskwarrior to do its setup.
5) Make sure that "python" executes to some Python 3 distribution.
6) Install the following Python package:
- jsonpath
- pandas
- matplotlib
- taskw
7) (Assuming you are in ~/core) cd into setup_scripts and run "source initial_setup.sh"

Now we're all set up!
